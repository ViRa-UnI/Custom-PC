# Customer PC Building Guide

Welcome to the Custom PC Building Module for Odoo Version 16 Community Edition. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own custom PC configuration using our intuitive interface.

## Getting Started

To begin building your custom PC, navigate to our eCommerce platform and locate the "Custom PC Builder" section.

### Step 1: Selecting Components

1. Start by selecting the **CPU**. You will see a list of available processors. Hover over each option to view more details, or click to select.
2. Next, choose your **GPU**. The system will automatically filter out incompatible options based on your CPU choice.
3. Continue selecting your **RAM**, **Storage**, and **Motherboard**. For each component, the system ensures compatibility with your previous selections.
4. Optionally, you can also choose additional components such as power supply units, cases, and cooling solutions.

### Step 2: Compatibility Checks

- As you select components, our system performs real-time compatibility checks.
- If there's a compatibility issue, you'll receive an immediate notification with suggestions for compatible alternatives.

### Step 3: Visualization

- Once you've selected all your components, you can view a visual representation of your assembled PC.
- Use the `#pc-visualization` area to see images and 3D models of your configuration.

### Step 4: Pricing and Inventory

- The total price of your configuration is dynamically calculated and displayed in the `#price-total` section.
- Our inventory management system ensures all selected components are in stock.

### Step 5: Wishlist and Sharing

- If you're not ready to purchase, you can save your configuration to your wishlist by clicking the `#wishlist-button`.
- Share your custom PC configuration with friends or on social media using the `#share-button`.

## Completing Your Order

After finalizing your selections, proceed to the **PC Configuration Summary View** to review your choices and the total price. If everything looks good, you can add your custom PC to the cart and proceed to checkout.
